 During my second year of college, my father began collecting vinyl records to re-visit his childhood music, purchasing a record player and other equipment to play them. One day, he came home with a TEAC cassette deck from a garage sale and spent a few hours trying to get it to function. While glancing at the interior of the machine while it was uncovered, I became curious about how audio tape worked. From there, my hobby of repairing cassette players and using them for my music began.

For many, our first impressions of cassette tapes are that they are cumbersome to use and sound bad--and my impressions were no different.
