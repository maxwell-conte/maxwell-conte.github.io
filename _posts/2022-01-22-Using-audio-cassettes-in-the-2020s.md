In 2019, my father began collecting vinyl records to re-visit his childhood music, purchasing a record player and other equipment to play them. One day, he came home with a TEAC cassette deck from a garage sale and spent a few hours trying to get it to function. While glancing at the interior of the machine while it was uncovered, I became curious about how audio tape worked. My hobby of repairing cassette players and using them for music was born.

For many, our first thoughts of cassette tapes are that they are cumbersome to use and sound bad--and my impressions were no different. However, with a thrifted 1990s Technics player and some prerecorded tapes, I was surprised about the decent sound quality. While I usually listened to music on Spotify or YouTube, cassettes became a way for me to make music physical and tangible--it made listening to music a more meaningful experience.
