In 2019, my father began collecting vinyl records to re-visit his childhood music, purchasing a record player and other equipment to play them. One day, he came home with a TEAC cassette deck from a garage sale and spent a few hours trying to get it to function. While glancing at the interior of the machine while it was uncovered, I became curious about how audio tape worked. My hobby of repairing cassette players and using them for music was born.

For many, our first thoughts of cassette tapes are that they are cumbersome to use and sound bad--and my impressions were no different. However, with a thrifted 1990s Technics player and some prerecorded tapes, I was surprised from how good the music sounded. While I usually listened to music on Spotify or YouTube, cassettes became a way for me to make music physical and tangible--it made listening to music a more meaningful experience.  

To make this hobby sustainable, however, learning to make repairs to machines is a necessity. To me, no great modern-day cassette players are in production, so sourcing good machines from the 1980s-1990s is the best chance of a good listening experience. These players often need minor repairs to get working again and overhauls to guarantee working condition for many more years. Having both electrical and mechanical components, repairing cassette players was exciting to me. It was also a chance to apply some of my electronics education.
